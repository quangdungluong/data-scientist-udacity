I was interested in using Stack Overflow Survey data from 2023 to answer the following questions:

1. Educational attainment
2. The most popular technologies
3. AI In Development workflow

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

A notebook titled `stack-overflow-developer-survey-2023.ipynb` is available here to demonstrate the analysis related to the aforementioned questions. The survey data utilized for this examination can be found in the `data` folder, and you have the option to download the data from [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/).

## Results<a name="results"></a>

1. Three-fourths of professional developer respondents have the equivalent of a bachelor's degree or higher.
2. Javascript & HTML/CSS comes out at the top as web development is one of today's most sought skills.
3. Developers using AI tools mostly report benefits for writing code.

The main findings of the code can also be found at the post available [here](https://dev.to/quangdungluong/some-insight-about-stack-overflow-survey-2023-576l).
